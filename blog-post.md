# Why gh-here is the Perfect Tool for Terminal-Heavy Developers

If you're like most developers in 2025, you probably spend a lot of time in the terminal. You're using Claude Code to generate and refactor code, running commands left and right, and iterating quickly on projects that haven't even been pushed to GitHub yet. But sometimes you need to step back and get a bird's-eye view of your codebase—and that's where `gh-here` shines.

## The Gap Between Terminal and IDE

Picture this scenario: You're deep in a terminal session, using Claude Code to implement a new feature. You've got files scattered across multiple directories, you're testing things with curl, and you're in that flow state where opening a heavy IDE would just break your momentum. But you need to:

- Quickly browse through your project structure
- Check what files you've modified
- Preview a README or markdown file
- Navigate between related files without losing context
- See language distribution across your codebase

This is the exact gap that `gh-here` fills.

## Built for Modern Development Workflows

### 1. **Perfect for AI-Assisted Development**
When you're working with Claude Code or GitHub Copilot, you're often generating and modifying files rapidly. `gh-here` gives you an instant, GitHub-like interface to review what's been changed without committing to version control or opening a full IDE.

### 2. **Ideal for Pre-Push Workflows**
Not everything needs to hit GitHub immediately. Whether you're experimenting with a proof of concept or working on a feature branch, `gh-here` lets you navigate and review your local changes in a familiar, web-based interface.

### 3. **Terminal-Native but GUI-Friendly**
Launch it with a single command (`gh-here`) from any directory, and instantly get a clean, GitHub-inspired interface in your browser. No configuration, no setup—just point and browse.

## Real-World Use Cases

**Scenario 1: Code Review Before Push**
```bash
$ claude "implement user authentication system"
# ... lots of generated files and changes
$ gh-here
# Browse through generated files, check git status, review changes
$ git add . && git commit -m "Add user authentication"
```

**Scenario 2: Project Exploration**
```bash
$ git clone some-interesting-repo
$ cd some-interesting-repo
$ gh-here
# Instantly get an overview: languages used, file structure, README preview
```

**Scenario 3: Documentation Review**
```bash
$ claude "update all the documentation"
$ gh-here
# Preview all the markdown files in GitHub-style rendering
# Check if everything looks good before committing
```

## Why Not Just Use GitHub or an IDE?

**GitHub**: Your code isn't pushed yet, or you're working on experimental changes you don't want in version control.

**IDE**: Too heavy for quick browsing, breaks your terminal flow, takes time to open and index.

**File Explorer**: No syntax highlighting, no git integration, no markdown rendering, no language stats.

**Terminal**: Great for editing, terrible for browsing and getting visual context.

## The Sweet Spot

`gh-here` hits the perfect sweet spot:
- **Lightweight**: Starts instantly, no heavy indexing
- **Familiar**: GitHub-style interface that every developer knows
- **Integrated**: Shows git status, handles various file types, renders markdown
- **Flexible**: Works with any directory, whether it's a git repo or not
- **Terminal-friendly**: Launch with one command, works alongside your existing workflow

## Features That Just Make Sense

- **Language statistics**: Instantly see what technologies your project uses
- **Git integration**: Visual git status indicators, diff viewing
- **File type support**: Syntax highlighting, image viewing, markdown rendering
- **Search functionality**: Quick file search with keyboard shortcuts
- **Breadcrumb navigation**: Always know where you are in your project

## Perfect for 2025 Development

As development workflows become more AI-assisted and terminal-centric, tools like `gh-here` become essential. You're not always in an IDE, you're not always ready to push to GitHub, but you always need to understand your codebase structure and changes.

It's the missing link between your terminal workflow and the visual context you need to stay productive.

## Get Started

```bash
npm install -g gh-here
cd your-project
gh-here
```

That's it. Your local codebase is now browsable in a clean, GitHub-style interface at `localhost:5556`.
