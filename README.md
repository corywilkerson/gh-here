# gh-here

A local GitHub-like file browser for viewing and exploring codebases in your browser. Launch it in any folder to get a beautiful web-based directory browser with syntax highlighting and powerful navigation features.

## Why?

TUIs (Terminal User Interfaces) like Claude Code, Google Gemini CLI, and Cursor have become very popular tools for working on codebases, but they don't provide a visual view into the directories and files themselves. gh-here exists to fill that gap, so you can easily explore your project files in a familiar GitHub-esque browser GUI.

<!-- Test change for commit interface -->

## Installation

Run gh-here directly with npx (no installation required):

```bash
npx gh-here
```

Or install it globally:

```bash
npm install -g gh-here
```

## Usage

Navigate to any directory and run:

```bash
gh-here                           # Start server on available port
gh-here --open                    # Start server and open browser
gh-here --port=8080               # Start server on port 8080
gh-here --open --browser=safari   # Start server and open in Safari
gh-here --open --browser=arc      # Start server and open in Arc
```

The app will automatically find an available port starting from 5555 and serve your current directory with a GitHub-like interface.
